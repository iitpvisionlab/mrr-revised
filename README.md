# Munsell Re-renotation: revised
A revised version of the psychophysical color difference Munsell Re-renotation dataset.

Munsell Re-renotation is a psychophysical dataset describing large color differences.
The dataset includes 2946 colors characterized by standard colorimetric coordinates (x, y, Y) and coordinates in Munsell system (h, V, C).
The Munsell Re-renotation dataset has been improved in terms of the uniformity of the system compared to the previous dataset version, Munsell Renotation.

Original Munsell Re-renotation data exists as a scanned report, that is available at http://www.rit-mcsl.org/MunsellRenotation/MunsellRe-renotations.pdf.
The repository contains Munsell Re-renotation data converted into a machine-readable format (.csv) and two revised versions: one with corrected misprints (34 items) that we found in the scanned report, and another with excluded ambiguous and duplicate colors (5 items).

The contents of the repository are:
- /README.md - this file
- /mrr_original.csv - Munsell Re-renotation original data
- /mrr_corrected.csv - Munsell Re-renotation data with corrected 34 erroneous colors
- /mrr_wo_ambiguous.csv - Munsell Re-renotation data with corrected 34 erroneous colors, 4 ambiguous colors and 1 duplicate color were excluded.
