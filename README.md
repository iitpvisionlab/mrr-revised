Revised version of the psychophysical color difference Munsell Re-renotation dataset.

Munsell Re-renotation is a psychophysical dataset describing large color differences.
The dataset includes 2946 colors characterized by standard colorimetric coordinates (x, y, Y) and coordinates in Munsell system (h, V, C).
Comparing with the previous dataset version, Munsell Renotation, Munsell Re-renotation is improved in terms of uniformity of the system.

Original Munsell Re-renotation data exists as a scanned report, that is available at http://web.archive.org/web/20210901124224/http://www.rit-mcsl.org/MunsellRenotation/MunsellRe-renotations.pdf.
The repository contains converted data into machine-readable format (.XLSX) and two revised versions: with corrected misprints (34 items) that we found in the report and with excluded ambiguous and duplicate colors (5 items).
